    "Now let's try a completely different type of model: **Decision Trees**!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Decision Tree?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a decision tree like a flowchart that you might use to make a decision. It asks a series of yes/no questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Is cancer volume > 2.5?\n",
    "├─ YES → Is patient age > 65?\n",
    "│        ├─ YES → Predict HIGH PSA\n",
    "│        └─ NO → Predict MEDIUM PSA\n",
    "└─ NO → Predict LOW PSA\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works:\n",
    "1. The model looks at all features and finds the best question to split the data\n",
    "2. It keeps splitting until it creates groups that are very similar\n",
    "3. For each group, it predicts the average PSA value\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros and Cons:\n",
    "✅ **Pros:**\n",
    "- Very easy to understand and explain\n",
    "- Can capture non-linear relationships (curves in data)\n",
    "- Works with both numbers and categories\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Cons:**\n",
    "- Can easily \"overfit\" (memorize training data instead of learning patterns)\n",
    "- Sometimes unstable (small data changes = big model changes)\n",
    "- May not perform as well as other models"

    "If one decision tree is good, what about many trees working together? That's a **Random Forest**!\n",

    "3. Build tree #3 to predict remaining errors → Combine with trees #1 and #2\n",
    "4. Keep going until errors are minimized!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:** Imagine studying for a test:\n",

    "\n",
    "Now let's interpret what we've learned from a **medical research perspective**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Model Performance**\n",
    "Our models were able to predict PSA levels with varying degrees of accuracy. The best model achieved an R² score of around 0.75, meaning it explains about 75% of the variation in PSA levels. This is quite good for medical data!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Most Important Features**\n",
    "Across different models, certain features consistently appeared as important:\n",
    "- **Cancer volume (lcavol)**: Usually the strongest predictor\n",
    "- **Capsular penetration (lcp)**: How far cancer has spread\n",
    "- **Weight/Size factors**: Prostate weight matters\n",
    "\n",
    "This aligns with medical knowledge - larger tumors and more aggressive spread correlate with higher PSA.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Clinical Implications**\n",
    "- These models could potentially **assist doctors** in:\n",
    "  - Screening decisions (who needs further testing?)\n",
    "  - Risk stratification (how aggressive is the cancer?)\n",
    "  - Treatment planning (what interventions are needed?)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **This is a learning exercise, not a medical tool!** Real clinical applications require:\n",
    "- Much larger datasets (thousands of patients, not 97)\n",
    "- Rigorous validation on independent datasets\n",
    "- Clinical trials and regulatory approval\n",
    "- Expert medical oversight\n",
    "- Consideration of ethical and bias issues\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Learned About Machine Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No single \"best\" model**: Different models have different strengths\n",
    "2. **Trade-offs matter**: \n",
    "   - Linear Regression: Simple, interpretable, fast\n",
    "   - Neural Networks: Powerful, complex, harder to interpret\n",
    "3. **Data quality is crucial**: Better data > fancier models\n",
    "4. **Validation is essential**: Always test on unseen data\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Your Research:\n",
    "\n",
    "You now have a foundation to:\n",
    "- Explore larger prostate cancer datasets\n",
    "- Experiment with different features and models\n",
    "- Compare tabular (table) data approaches with image-based approaches\n",
